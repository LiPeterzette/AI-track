The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and financial big data technologies has provided a new research paradigm for accurate forecasting of energy price volatility. Through deep learning techniques, especially models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, deep patterns in multi-source data can be mined and combined with multi-dimensional data such as geopolitics, macroeconomic indicators, and market supply and demand to build more accurate and robust prediction models. This study will focus on the characteristics of crude oil and natural gas price fluctuations in the energy futures market, taking into account the indirect impact of geopolitical events on price fluctuations and the dynamic moderating effect of macroeconomic indicators on market confidence.
